**As a** Business Analyst, **I want** the system to extract and format action items in a structured table **so that** I can clearly track what needs to be done, by whom, and by when.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System identifies action items from meeting notes
- Action items are presented in a table format with columns for item, owner, and deadline
- System attempts to auto-populate owner and deadline fields when information is available
- Empty fields are visually indicated for manual completion
- Table is sortable by different columns
- Action items include sufficient context to understand the task

**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** Medium (M)
