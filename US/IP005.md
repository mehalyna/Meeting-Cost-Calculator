**As a** Delivery Manager, **I want** the system to process my notes even if they're incomplete or unstructured **so that** I can get value from the tool regardless of note-taking style.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System handles bullet points, paragraphs, and mixed formatting
- System works with notes that don't follow a specific template
- System provides reasonable output even with minimal input
- If processing fails, system gracefully degrades to basic text editor
- System suggests ways to improve note quality for better results
- System handles common abbreviations and shorthand

**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** Medium (M)
