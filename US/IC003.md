**As a** Delivery Manager, **I want** the system to detect meeting details from calendar invitations **so that** I don't have to manually enter meeting information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System can connect to Microsoft or Google calendar
- System extracts meeting title, date, time, and attendees
- System pre-populates meeting information fields
- User can edit extracted information if needed
- Connection is secure and requires appropriate permissions
- System handles calendar connection errors gracefully

**Priority:** Low
**Estimated Effort:** Large (L)
