- Estimated completion time is shown for longer operations
- Success messages confirm when actions are completed
- Error messages are clear and suggest resolution steps
- Status updates don't block the interface unnecessarily
- System recovers gracefully from errors

**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** Small (S)
