**As a** Project Manager, **I want** to export action items directly to JIRA **so that** I can track them in our project management system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System provides "Export to JIRA" option for action items
- User can authenticate with JIRA credentials
- System maps action item fields to appropriate JIRA fields
- User can select JIRA project and issue type
- System provides confirmation when issues are created
- System handles errors gracefully if JIRA is unavailable

**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** Large (L)
